# Image Organization and Naming Guide

## Purpose
This document is intended to provide a comprehensive guide for organizing and naming image files within the repository. 

## General Principles
1. **Simplicity**: Choose clear, descriptive names that indicate what the image is about.
2. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent naming convention throughout the project.
3. **Organization**: Categorically organize images into folders to enhance findability.

## Naming Convention
1. **Descriptive Names**: Names should describe the content of the image. For instance, use `dog-playing-fetch.jpg` instead of `IMG001.jpg`.
2. **Lowercase Letters**: Use lowercase letters to avoid issues on case-sensitive file systems.
3. **Use Hyphens for Spaces**: Replace spaces with hyphens (`-`) instead of underscores (`_`) or keeping spaces. For example, `family-vacation-2023.jpg` is preferred.
4. **Date Format**: If images are date-specific, use the format `YYYY-MM-DD` at the beginning of the file name. For example, `2023-05-01-lake-trip.jpg`.
5. **Versioning**: If updates are made to an image, append a version number at the end before the file extension (e.g., `dog-playing-fetch-v2.jpg`).

## Folder Structure
- **/images**: The root folder for all images.
- **Categories**: Create subfolders within the `/images` folder to categorize images. For instance:
   - `/images/nature`
   - `/images/people`
   - `/images/events`

## Examples
1. **Nature Images**: 
   - `2023-05-01-sunset-beach.jpg`
   - `forest-in-autumn.jpg`
2. **Event Images**:
   - `2023-06-15-wedding-reception.jpg`
   - `conference-2023-networking-session.jpg`

## Conclusion
Following these guidelines will help maintain an organized and easy-to-navigate image repository, enhance collaboration, and improve accessibility to visual resources.
