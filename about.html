                <p class="about-tagline">I wasn't trying to become "The Fixer." It just happened.</p>

                <p class="about-text">I studied tourism because I love Nepal. I love the mountains, the temples, the way strangers become family over dal bhat. I thought I'd spend my career showing people beautiful places.</p>

                <p class="about-text">Then reality hit.</p>

                <div class="crisis-story">
                    <h2 style="color: var(--warm); margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Saturday That Changed Everything</h2>
                    <p>A guest arrived with kidney failure. It was Saturday – the worst day for medical emergencies in Nepal. No plan. No hospital arranged. Family panicking.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">I found the hospital. I coordinated the dialysis. I rebuilt their entire itinerary around keeping him alive. They saw Nepal and went home safe.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: 600;">That's when I realized: beautiful places don't prevent bad things from happening. But having someone who knows what to do? That changes everything.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="about-text">After that, the crises kept coming. A family hit by a truck at 2am. An 8-year-old injured. Flights cancelled. Vehicles broken down at midnight. A guest whose parent died mid-trip – I cancelled everything and rescheduled for whenever they were ready.</p>

                <p class="about-text">I could have panicked. I could have said "not my problem." Instead, I solved. Every time.</p>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    <p>"At 7am after a night with no sleep, I was at their hotel making sure the 8-year-old was okay. That's not a service package. That's just who I am."</p>
                </div>

                <p class="about-text">Now I've built my business around what I accidentally became good at: fixing things when they break. My education taught me the theory. Two years on the ground taught me the truth.</p>

                <h2 style="margin: 3rem 0 1rem; color: var(--deep);">Why Travel With Me?</h2>

                <div class="why-grid">

                        <strong>Not a call center:</strong> When you call, I answer. Not an assistant. Not voicemail. Me.

                    <div class="why-item">
                        <strong>Not theoretical:</strong> I've handled kidney failure, accidents, deaths. Your problem isn't my first.
                    </div>
                    <div class="why-item">
                        <strong>Not 9-to-5:</strong> I've driven through the night. I've shown up at 7am. I don't clock out.

                    <div class="why-item">
                        <strong>Not fake promises:</strong> I tell you what could go wrong and how I'll handle it. No surprises.
