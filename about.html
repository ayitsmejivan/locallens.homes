                <p><strong>Why I became The Fixer:</strong> Early in my career, a group got caught in unexpected weather during high-altitude trekking. We had no contingency plan. No backup. No clear communication. In those hours, I learned that beautiful tours and experienced guides aren't enough. You need systems. You need someone who refuses to let panic dictate outcomes.</p>
            </aside>

            <h2 class="section-heading fade-in">Who I Am</h2>

            <p class="fade-in">Over the past two years, I've managed over 500 tour groups across Nepal's most challenging environments. I've guided people through natural disasters, medical emergencies, security threats, and logistical nightmares that most tour operators couldn't handle. I don't just manage crises. I prevent them. And when prevention fails, I respond with the experience and clarity that saves lives.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading fade-in">What I've Managed</h2>

            <article class="day-card fade-in">
                <h3 class="day-title">Medical Emergencies</h3>
                <p>From altitude sickness to acute injuries. I coordinate evacuation, manage communication with hospitals, and stay with clients through treatment. I've handled over 50 medical situations without major incidents.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="day-card fade-in">
                <h3 class="day-title">Weather & Natural Disasters</h3>
                <p>Unexpected storms, landslides, avalanche risks. I read conditions, pivot routes, and ensure safe evacuation when necessary. I've weathered monsoons, earthquakes, and freak mountain storms.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="day-card fade-in">
                <h3 class="day-title">Security & Political Events</h3>
                <p>Border closures, civil unrest, safety threats. I monitor situations daily and have protocols to keep groups safe and informed. I've navigated multiple political situations without compromising group safety.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="day-card fade-in">
                <h3 class="day-title">Logistical Failures</h3>
                <p>Lost luggage, cancelled flights, guide no-shows, accommodation issues. I have backup plans for backup plans. When things fall apart, I make them work.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="day-card fade-in">
                <h3 class="day-title">Communication Crisis</h3>
                <p>Lost members, equipment failure, connectivity issues. I have satellite devices, local contacts, and real-time response protocols. You're never truly unreachable.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="day-card fade-in">
                <h3 class="day-title">Psychological Support</h3>
                <p>Fear, anxiety, conflict within groups. I manage group dynamics and provide emotional support during stressful situations. A calm guide is worth more than all the equipment.</p>
            </article>

            <div class="inclusions-box fade-in">
                <h3>My Approach:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prevention Over Reaction.</strong> Detailed briefings, equipment checks, health screening, weather monitoring prevent most crises before they start.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency & Communication.</strong> You know what could go wrong, what I'm monitoring, exactly what I'll do if situations change. No surprises.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Network.</strong> I have relationships with hospitals, government officials, rescue teams, community leaders. When I need help, doors open.</li>
                    <li><strong>24/7 Availability.</strong> On every tour, I'm available around the clock. At 2 AM, you call me directly. Just immediate response.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="cta-box fade-in">
                <h2>You're Not Just a Client</h2>
                <p>When you book a tour with me, you're not booking a package. You're booking peace of mind. You're booking someone who has been tested in real situations and hasn't failed.</p>
