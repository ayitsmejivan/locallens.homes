                <p><strong>Why I can offer this:</strong> Most tour operators don't have relationships with these communities. I've spent years building trust with the honey hunters of Gorkha. You're not watching a show for tourists. You're witnessing something real, with someone who respects it.</p>
            </aside>

            <h2 class="section-heading fade-in">What This Experience Actually Is</h2>

            <p class="fade-in">This is not a performance. This is not something we created for tourists. The Gurung and Magar communities have been harvesting wild honey this way for centuries. You'll be a respectful guest, not a spectator at a show.</p>

                <h3 class="day-title">Day 1: Kathmandu to Gorkha</h3>
                <p>5–6 hour drive through mountains. We leave early. I've done this drive 30+ times – I know where to stop, where to eat, and which roads to avoid during monsoon. Overnight in a local village homestay. Dinner with the family. This is where you start to understand.</p>

                <h3 class="day-title">Day 2: Meeting the Hunters</h3>
                <p>Meet the team who will risk their lives tomorrow. They'll show you their equipment – handmade rope ladders, bamboo sticks, smoke torches. You'll learn about the traditions, the rituals, the prayers they say before descending. If you're lucky, they'll let you taste last season's honey. It might do things to you. (Ask me about "mad honey" when we meet.)</p>

            <article class="day-card fade-in">
                <h3 class="day-title">Day 3: Trek to the Cliff</h3>
                <p>2–3 hour walk through forest to the cliff base. The bees (<em>Apis laboriosa</em> – world's largest honeybees) build their hives on sheer rock faces. You'll hear them before you see them. We set up a safe viewing spot. The hunters prepare. Everything depends on the bees, the weather, the spirits. We wait. We watch.</p>

                <h3 class="day-title">Day 4: The Harvest (If Conditions Allow)</h3>
                <p>This is why you came. One man descends on a rope ladder. Another controls the smoke from above. The bees swarm. The hunter cuts the comb with a long pole. It falls. You'll hold your breath. I've seen it 12 times. I still hold my breath.</p>

                <p>If the harvest happened yesterday, we might witness another. If not, we try again. Or we spend the day in the village – learning about their lives, their traditions, how honey hunting fits into a world that's changing fast.</p>

                <p>We thank the hunters properly. You'll have a chance to buy honey (limited – these communities rely on it). Drive back to Kathmandu. You'll be quiet on the drive. That's normal.</p>

                <p>Built in because remote areas don't run on schedules. Roads fail. Weather happens. I've learned to always add a buffer. You'll thank me later.</p>
